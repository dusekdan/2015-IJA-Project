Board game Labyrinth created in Java by cooperating authors [Daniel Dusek](https://github.com/DusekDan) (xdusek21) and [Filip Kalous](https://github.com/Strihtrs) (xkalou03).

To run the game, enter the directory where the directory structure is located in console and run command `ant compile`.
This action will download images from the student web and stores them to the resources. 
Right after that run the game with command "ant run" and you are ready to go.

After launching the game, you will have several options how to start playing:

1. Create a new game, by button that is located in the left menu
    * while creating a new game, you can choose the size of the gameboard (5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11)
    * you can also select how many players will be in the game
    * and finally, the amount of treasures that will be generated to the gamefield (12 or 24, for 5x5 is allowed only the amount of 12)

2. Load the game, from a saved file on your hard drive

3. When playing, there is option to save the game, that will save the current state of the game. This process saves the game to the *.dat file,
that you can use later to load the game.

4. Despite the fact this game is a labyrinth, it is certainly not a prison, therefore you can always leave the game by hitting "Exit game" button.


GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN!
